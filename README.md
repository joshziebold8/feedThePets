**Feed The Pets App**
Basic functionality will allow users to sign into an account and mark that they have fed the pet. Once this is done all users in a group (family or roommates etc.) will be able to log on and see who last fed the pet and at what time. Additional functionality could include setting reminders for appointments or medications. It could also keep a history of medical records. The pet could also have a profile of what kind of pet and other characteristics and there could be an option to send an alert if it goes missing. Another idea would be for the pet’s weight and activity to be tracked. There could be an option to connect with other people through the app and they can see everything about your pet and to find someone to help you feed/take care of your pet.

Then you must navigate to the projectCode directory.
 After doing so you must run the command docker-compose up in your terminal and the init process will start and the app will be spun up

To access the working application you must finally navigate to the url http://localhost:3001/
