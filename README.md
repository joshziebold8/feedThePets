**Feed The Pets App**
Basic functionality will allow users to sign into an account and mark that they have fed the pet. Once this is done all users in a group (family or roommates etc.) will be able to log on and see who last fed the pet and at what time.

Deployment:
Our project is a local web application so we don’t have any external access to our app. To access our app you must first pull from our github repo, https://github.com/CU-CSCI-3308-Fall-2021/CSCI-3308-Fall21-015-05

Then you must navigate to the projectCode directory.
 After doing so you must run the command docker-compose up in your terminal and the init process will start and the app will be spun up

To access the working application you must finally navigate to the url http://localhost:3001/

To log into the page you may either create an account with the hyperlink in the bottom right corner of the page or you may use one of the pre-existing accounts already loaded into the database.
